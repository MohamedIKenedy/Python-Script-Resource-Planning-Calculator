This agreement gives you exclusive rights to use the work I’ve created for you commercially, while I keep the ownership and copyright. You’re free to use it for the intended purposes, but it can’t be sublicensed, or shared beyond what we’ve agreed without checking in with me first. The payment terms and cancellation details are also included(In replit policy and IP agreement terms) to make sure everything’s clear and we’re both covered. Thanks, and looking forward to seeing the project take off!
